# Guess My Number 
### Started this game to practice DOM manipulation

<p text-align="left">This game is called Guess my number. The goal of the game is to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. We can type a number, and check if we were right. If not, we will see a hint to the next guess, if it was to high, to low, etc. Also we can see that we start with a score of 20 and decreases by one with every try. Highscore stands for the best score made through the different matches, that's why when we want to start again, we press "Again!" but it does not reset the "Highscore" record.</p>
