<p align="center">This game is called "Guess My Number". 
<br>
The goal of the game is to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. We can type a number, and check if we were right. If the number was incorrect, we will see a hint to the next guess, if it was to high, to low, etc. 
<br>
Be careful, the score starts at 10 by default, but decreases by one with every try, if you arrive to zero, the game is over.
<br> 
Highscore instead, stands for the best score made through the different matches, that's why when we want to start again, we press "Again!" but it does not reset the "Highscore" record. That way you can keep track of your best score.
